# You want latexmk to *always* run, because make does not have all the info.
# Also, include non-file targets in .PHONY so they are run regardless of any
# file of the given name existing.
.PHONY: $(PROJNAME).pdf all clean

# The first rule in a Makefile is the one executed by default ("make"). It
# should always be the "all" rule, so that "make" and "make all" are identical.
all: $(PROJNAME).pdf

# MAIN LATEXMK RULE

# -pdf tells latexmk to generate PDF directly (instead of DVI).
# -pdflatex="" tells latexmk to call a specific backend with specific options.
# -use-make tells latexmk to call make for generating missing files.

# -interactive=nonstopmode keeps the pdflatex backend from stopping at a
# missing file reference and interactively asking you for an alternative.

$(PROJNAME).pdf: $(PROJNAME).tex
	latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex -interactive=nonstopmode" -use-make $<

# Remove all build files including .ps and .pdf files
cleanall:
	latexmk -C

# Remove all build files excluding .ps and .pdf files
clean:
